Your role is to compress the recent trajectory into a concise summary that an agent can reuse next step.

Game Description:
{manual}

Recent history (most recent last):
{recent_history}

Previous rolling summary:
{previous_summary}

Task:
- Produce a new summary ≤25 tokens.
- Mention agent location, key items/inventory, goals/hazards, and momentum toward objectives.
- Do not restate every step; only the most salient facts.
- If the history is empty, return "Start of game".
- Do not only repeat an action, but summarize what actions led to what outcomes.

Respond strictly in this exact format. The summary should be one sentence only, but you can use a comma.  
Summary: <concise summary here>
